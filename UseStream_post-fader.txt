workflow -- stream mix as post-fader strategy from collaborate worship

pair of bux or aux-mixes (stereo)
go thru each channel and set TAP point
  most channels set to POST fader (so room vol changes)
  
  Select live stream bus
  config tab -- highlight "Post Fader" on "CH SENDS CONFIG" knob and press ASSIGN
  this sets all channels to POST FADER for that bus
  
  PASTOR MIC's should be PRE-FADER, 
  AMBIANT MIC's should be PRE-FADER
  PRE-SERVICE/Video feed music should be PRE-FADER 

  How: if CH-1 is PASTOR mic, select it
    navigate to SENDS tab, and select LIVE STREAM bus
    page-down and set mode to PRE for PRE-FADER
  
    repeat for AMBIANT MICs, pre-service and video-feeds
  
  ===========================
  Now create a STARTING configuration for LIVE STREAM mix
  
  TAP - SENDS ON FADER and then select the LIVE STREAM BUS
    Now set all VOX to -5 dB all the same
	 Now set all INSTRUMENTS to 0 dB
	 Set PASTOR mics to 0 dB as well
	 Set AMBIANT mics to -10 dB 
	 Set Pre-service and Video-feeds to -10 dB 
	 Also check that they are UN-MUTED on LIVE STREAM BUS!
	 
================================
	 APPLY a LIMITER -- it isn't loud enough?
	 Example: use FX-8, set input INSERTS to LIVE-STREAM buses
	 change TYPE to LIM (precision limiter)
	   now navigate to FX-8 "Effect" tab, 
		check 'stereo link' selected, auto-gain is OFF
		set INPUT gain to 12 dB
		set OUTPUT gain to -1 dB
		set Squeeze to 20%
		set KNEE to 3dB
		set ATTACK to 0.5ms
		set RELEASE to 150ms
		adjust INPUT gain during LOUD portion of band so that GAIN REDUCTION 3-4 dB at most
		
NOW -- select LIVE STREAM BUS, and HOME button
		navigate to CONFIG tab and set INSERT position to POST 
		-- this makes the LIMITER *LAST* guy in chain
		
=================================
AMBIANT mics
small diaphram condensors on each side of stage a few feet behind main speakers
linked as STEREO pair
set gain for them when room full of sound, add LOW CUT at 300 Hz

=================================
EQ for audio quality loss of youtube/facebook
   Find EQ -- set shelving +6 dB at 12Khz

Add REVERB to the mix, and PANNING
  use same REVERB as main MX, 
  select FX-returns, navigate to SENDS TAB
  make sure LIVE STREAM bus is set PRE-FADER
  set LEVEL to -5 dB 
  repeat this for all FX-returns used in main mix
  
  PANNING -- NEVER PAN LEAD VOX -- BASS/KICK/SNARE
  
COMPRESSION
   KICK drum example: 
	   Ratio 5:1  gain 6dB,  Attack 10ms, Hold 0ms, release 120ms
		threshold so that gain reduction is -6 dB at most
