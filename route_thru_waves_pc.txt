ascension worship 
   Super Rack performer Native version (existing 2018 laptop)
   Thru USB port not waves card
   2 plugsin -- realtime tune + waves F6
   
Tricky routing -- be simple at first (what M32 cant) 
   F6 - dynamic EQ really nice

If *OFF* then level/EQ should not be impacted REALLY...
That way if turned off it isn't catastrophic

Waves New Session
   Setup 
       Smallest size (he did 96) latency vs glitches
	   
   Settings 32 racks
   Last State  = startup  session
   
   Patch = Latency Group 1 == ALL 32 channels together
   
   Overview 1 (all 32)
   Press DOWN arrow under "Rack 1" and select "Auto-Route all RACKS"
   give 1:1 patch across

   Example: his setup has 16 local imputs 
   
   On M32 -- 
      ROUTING -- USER In/Outs
	  Start with OUTPUTS (what is sent to Waves computer) 
	     User Out1:    Local In  "Local In 1"
	     User Out2:    Local In  "Local In 2" etc... down to 16/32
		 
      This puts SOURCES to USER Outputs
      Now need to send USER Outputs to Computer

      Tab over to EXPANSION CARD OUT
	  Change all to USER Outputs 1 .. 16 (in his case) 
	  
	  That means active raw signals sent over to Waves PC 
	  
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 
      Now we need to get processed signals back into Mixer
	  
	  ROUTING -- USER In/Outs
	  Select INPUTS (coming from Waves computer) 
	  	     User In 1:    Card In  "Card In 1"
	  	     User In 2:    Card In  "Card In 2"  etc... down to 16/32
			 
      Now need to send USER Inputs to actual CHANNELS
      
	  Tab over to INPUT Processing Block Patch
	  change to USER-IN and select USER-IN 1..16 (or 32) to "USER In"
	  
	  Now Waves PC output is returning to each channel.
	  
-----------------------------------------------------------

Now SETUP 2 Snippets

  1 -- LIVE mode  (without PC)
	2 -- WAVES mode (with PC)
	
  *** SNIPPETS ***
	
	Navigate to SCENES/Snippets 
	   Select Parameters   INSERT
	   Select no effects
	   Select CONSOLE      ROUTING, User In, User Out, 
	   Select CHANNELS     selected 'vocal' channels being used (9-12 for him)
	   SAVE , SAVE "WAVES" Confirm
	   
	BACK to USER input ROUTING (all the way on right)
	    Select INPUT
		   Put User Input "In1 : Ln01" (local 1) or whatever is normal
		   Put User Input "In2 : Ln02" (local 1) etc...  up to 16/32
	  
	Now Original INPUTS are	restored to Mixer	

    Navigate to SCENES/Snippets 
	   Select Parameters   INSERT
	   Select no effects
	   Select CONSOLE      ROUTING, User In, User Out,
