ascension worship 
   Super Rack performer Native version (existing 2018 laptop)
   Thru USB port not waves card
   2 plugsin -- realtime tune + waves F6
   
Tricky routing -- be simple at first (what M32 cant) 
   F6 - dynamic EQ really nice

If *OFF* then level/EQ should not be impacted REALLY...
That way if turned off it isn't catastrophic

Waves New Session
   Setup 
       Smallest size (he did 96) latency vs glitches
	   
   Settings 32 racks
   Last State  = startup  session
   
   Patch = Latency Group 1 == ALL 32 channels together
   
   Overview 1 (all 32)
   Press DOWN arrow under "Rack 1" and select "Auto-Route all RACKS"
   give 1:1 patch across

   Example: his setup has 16 local imputs 
   
   On M32 -- 
      ROUTING -- USER In/Outs
	  Start with OUTPUTS (what is sent to Waves computer) 
	     User Out1:    Local In  "Local In 1"
	     User Out2:    Local In  "Local In 2" etc... down to 16/32
		 
      This puts SOURCES to USER Outputs
      Now need to send USER Outputs to Computer

      Tab over to EXPANSION CARD OUT
	  Change all to USER Outputs 1 .. 16 (in his case) 
	  
	  That means active raw signals sent over to Waves PC 
	  
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 
      Now we need to get processed signals back into Mixer
	  
	  ROUTING -- USER In/Outs
	  Select INPUTS (coming from Waves computer) 
	  	     User In 1:    Card In  "Card In 1"
	  	     User In 2:    Card In  "Card In 2"  etc... down to 16/32
			 
      Now need to send USER Inputs to actual CHANNELS
      
	  Tab over to INPUT Processing Block Patch
	  change to USER-IN and select USER-IN 1..16 (or 32) to "USER In"
	  
	  Now Waves PC output is returning to each channel.
	  
-----------------------------------------------------------

Now SETUP 2 Snippets

  1 -- LIVE mode  (without PC)
	2 -- WAVES mode (with PC)
	
  *** SNIPPETS ***
	
	Navigate to SCENES/Snippets 
	   Select Parameters   INSERT
	   Select no effects
	   Select CONSOLE      ROUTING, User In, User Out, 
	   Select CHANNELS     selected 'vocal' channels being used (9-12 for him)
	   SAVE , SAVE "WAVES" Confirm
	   
	BACK to USER input ROUTING (all the way on right)
	    Select INPUT
		   Put User Input "In1 : Ln01" (local 1) or whatever is normal
		   Put User Input "In2 : Ln02" (local 1) etc...  up to 16/32
	  
	Now Original INPUTS are	restored to Mixer	

    Navigate to SCENES/Snippets 
	   Select Parameters   INSERT
	   Select no effects
	   Select CONSOLE      ROUTING, User In, User Out, 
	   Select CHANNELS     selected 'vocal' channels being used (9-12 for him)
	   SAVE , SAVE "LIVE" Confirm	

Then can SWTICH back/forth from PC processed and NOT loading 1 of these SNIPPETS!!
ASSIGN A SET OF BUTTONS TO DO THIS!!!
Set -C -- 
Button 10        -- JUMP TO PAGE "SCENE" "Bits" 
Button 11 & 12   -- SNIPPET RECALL LIVE/ SNIPPET RECALL WAVES

IF PC starts to ACT UP -- or anything wierd, to [C]-[10][11] or [C]-[10][12]

===============================================================
Second part of VIDEO
===============================================================

Setup Vocal channels thru INSERT point ..


If wierd patch, write it down on paper before attempting this!!!

First 4 inputs 1 -- 4  listening to Local-in 1.. 4
swap with vocals (for him 9 .. 12 Local-in 9..12)
 
 ** save scene!! ** 
 ** Also during this patch switch LIVE may be impacted, so TURN DOWN MASTERS **
 
Start with Swapping  
  On Waves PC
      Lower portion of RACK Change output channels
	     Rack -1 Output from 1  to  Out 9
		 Rack -2 Output from 1  to  Out 10
		 Rack -3 Output from 1  to  Out 11
		 Rack -4 Output from 1  to  Out 12
		 
	     Rack -9  Output from 1  to  Out 1
		 Rack -10 Output from 1  to  Out 2
		 Rack -11 Output from 1  to  Out 3
		 Rack -12 Output from 1  to  Out 4		 
		 
  On MIXER 
     CHANGE  TO **WAVES** MODE (via SNIPPETS)
	 
     USER OUTPUTs (going to WAVES computer)
      instead of being Local in, Change to AUX -OUT- *not *IN**
	  
	  So User Out 9:  to AUX-01
	     User Out 10: to AUX-02
	     User Out 11: to AUX-03
		 User Out 12: to AUX-04
	  
	  Toggle over to USER INPUTS
	     User In 1:  -- 4   instead of CARD 1 .. 4
		    make them Card 9 .. 12
			
	     User In 1: to Card 9	
	     User In 2: to Card 10
		 User In 3: to Card 11
	     User In 4: to Card 12		 
			
		 User In 9:  to original source (Local-9)
		 User In 10: to original source (Local-10)
		 User In 11: to original source (Local-11)
		 User In 12: to original source (Local-12)	  
		 
NOW --- In (all the way to left) INPUT BLOCKS which *WERE* USER-1..32

    	change AUX-IN from AUX-IN (actual 1/4 inch)
		    Change to CARD 1-4  (*not* USER 1..4)
			
At this point, everything should be coming through the channels

   LAST THING...
      CHANNEL  9 -- CONFIG INSERT "Aux-1" POST to use WAVES as INSERT effect
      CHANNEL 10 -- CONFIG INSERT "Aux-2" POST to use WAVES as INSERT effect
      CHANNEL 11 -- CONFIG INSERT "Aux-3" POST to use WAVES as INSERT effect
      CHANNEL 12 -- CONFIG INSERT "Aux-4" POST to use WAVES as INSERT effect
	  
NOW -- Update the WAVES Snippet with this routing !!

*** WHY DID YOU MAP 1 ... 4 ??? ***
Thatâ€™s unfortunately a necessity for the X32 because of how the insert 
function works. I mention it briefly in the video - the inserts can only work 
with inputs 1-2, 1-4, or 1-6 via Aux-In Remap. 
Unless your vocal channels happen to land on those channels on your original 
patch, this routing allows you to put them in no matter where they are plugged in. 

I hope that helps to clear things up a bit :)
