Channel Processing BLOCK PATCH
  Change each column to 
  [USER In 1-8], [USER In 9-16], [USER In 17-24], [USER In 25-32]
  
Expansion CARD OutPuts
  Select the same thing	
  [USER In 1-8], [USER In 9-16], [USER In 17-24], [USER In 25-32]
  
Patch-->USER
  INPUT
	In 1  - Local In 1   could be ANYTHING ...
	....
	In 32 - Local In 32
	
EXAMPLE: '32-track recording' will use 30 channels from stage and also record Master L/R'
  OUTPUT (48 channels out over AES-50)   ex: 30 from offstage, 31/32 as L/R Mix
  
Check the OUTPUT section (not USER Patch Output) to get actual 'Output Assignment'
    Original Output-16 = MAIN LRC 'R' Post-Fader
	Original Output-15 = MAIN LRC 'L' Post-Fader
	
Patch-->USER
   OUTPUT
   	
	Original Output 1-8 ???
	
	Change Output-31 = OUTPUT Output 15 (this was MAIN LRC 'R') above
	Change Output-32 = OUTPUT Output 16 (this was MAIN LRC 'L') above
	
	Change Output-33 - 48 to P16-1 thru P16-16 
	
Now change user output section on CARD
Expansion CARD Outputs (again?)
  [USER Out 1-8], [USER Out 9-16], [USER Out 17-24], [USER Out 25-32]
  
NOTE:
  If using P-16 make sure USER P-16 1 thru 16 are on OUTPUT 33 thru 48
